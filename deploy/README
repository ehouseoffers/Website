Deployment takes place in several stages:
  - Preparation
  - Gem Bundling
  - Default Configuration
  - Database Migration
    * The deploy hook deploy/before_migrate.rb runs
    - The migration command is run
    * The deploy hook deploy/after_migrate.rb runs
  - Symlink
    * The deploy hook deploy/before_symlink.rb runs
    - The symlink /data/<appname>/current is created pointing to /data/<appname>/releases/<timestamp>
    * The deploy hook deploy/after_symlink.rb runs
  - Restart Application Servers
    * The deploy hook deploy/before_restart.rb runs
    - The application servers are restarted
    * The deploy hook deploy/after_restart.rb runs
  - Cleanup

Note!
In order for migrations to run, your entire environment will be loaded. So if you have any symlinks that need to be
created in order for the application to start properly you will want to put them in before_migrate.rb instead of
before_symlink.rb, since before_symlink.rb runs after the migration.

You will have some of the same variables you are used to from Capistrano:
  - release_path : this is the full path to the current release: e.g. /data/appname/releases/12345678
  - shared_path  : this is the path to the shared dir: e.g. /data/appname/shared
  - current_path : this is the path to the currently symlinked release: e.g. /data/appname/current
  - node         : node is the full hash object of all the info we know about your applications and deployments.
